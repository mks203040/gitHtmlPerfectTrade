This is a modified version of Folio-Gallery script by by stefan [linudaar]. I adds ability for captions.

These are the features added.

1. Added possibility to use album captions for each album by checking for the content of a file ".caption" within the album folder. The caption is displayed in the album overview page under the (random) album image

2. Possibility to use album descriptions for each album by checking for the content of a file ".description". The description is displayed under the title bar in an album page.

3. Possibility to add captions for certain images. The captions have to be in a file ".image-captions" that needs to have a csv format (filename;short-caption;long-caption). If no long caption is specified (3rd column), the long caption is equal to the short caption. The image captions are displayed - if they exist - under the thumb of the image. The long caption is displayed in the popup.
